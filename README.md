(Simile-Free) Monad Recipes
============================

Abstract
---------

Most tutorials explain the whole monad burrito by first growing the wheat to make the tortilla. Metaphors can sometimes get in the way of the simple fact that most Haskell code boils down to five essential monads: IO, Reader, Writer, State and Error.

The good news is they are easy to grok because the syntax is familiar and the semantics are already well understood by programmers of all stripes.

This talk will focus simply on how to use them with no metaphors and simple code examples that do something useful.

Attendees will leave the session knowing how to write real, useful apps in Haskell.

Target Audience:
---------------

This talk is aimed at those who:

1. have been exposed to little functional programming via JavaScript/Python/Ruby/etc,

2. have seen simple examples of Haskell's IO monad and do-notation and,

3. would like to know how Haskell can be used to emulate those imperative idioms they are already familiar with.
